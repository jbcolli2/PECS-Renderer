# PECS-Renderer
A Pre-Entity Component System Rendering engine.  This rendering engine is the next step after working through LearnOpenGL.org.  A piecemeal engine was created while working through that tutorial, but it was not very efficient or well designed as all the aspects of graphics programming and the OpenGL API were being learned as the engine was being written.  Therefore, that engine was scrapped and a new one is being designed.  

I know that the rendering logic and the object data need to be kept seperate in graphics programming, especially with OpenGL.  If the rendering is done in multiple places, i.e. in each of the game object's code, then the current state of OpenGL would never be really known.  It also eliminates any of the AZDO(Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) techniques are hard or impossible to acheive when the rendering calls are done in the object code.  This leads me to see the rendering at least should be somewhate ECS, where the rendering data lives with the object, while the rendering logic is in some RenderingPipeline class.

Therefore, it seems to mee that some form of ECS is the best way to go about implementing rendering using OpenGL.  However, as ECS is new to me, I want to take on as few challenges as possible at a time.  Therefore, I plan to implement an object-oriented ECS engine.  While this seems against the grain for ECS, it allows me to examine a component model, while not having to worry about the data oriented design aspect of it.
